# pwrl-learnings-extract — Learning Extraction

**Purpose:** Entry point to the learnings workflow. Scans source materials (code, commits, tasks, docs, errors, reviews) for learning signals and extracts actionable learning candidates. Produces extraction artifact consumed by pwrl-learnings-classify.

## Interaction Method

- Accepts source type and content as input.
- Minimal interaction; primarily automated scanning and extraction.
- Ask user only if source ambiguous: "Is this code or configuration?"
- Show extraction progress and candidate count.
- No approval gate; proceed to next skill.

## Input

User provides:

```
source_type: code | commit | task | documentation | error | review
source_content: [File content, commit message, error trace, etc.]
context:
  file_path: [optional]
  line_range: [optional]
  task_id: [optional]
  timestamp: [optional]
```

## Output: Extraction Artifact

Emit extraction artifact (YAML + markdown):

```yaml
---
format: pwrl-learnings-extract-artifact
version: "1.0"
extract_id: YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-extract
created: ISO-8601-timestamp
source_type: code | commit | task | documentation | error | review
source_ref: [file_path | commit_hash | task_id | error_id]

Artifact passed to `pwrl-learnings-classify`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Validate Input

1. Check that source type is one of: code, commit, task, documentation, error, review
2. Verify source content is provided
3. If context available, validate timestamps and references
4. **If validation fails:**
   - Ask user to clarify source type
   - Retry validation

### Step 2: Scan for Learning Signals

**For source_type = "code":**

1. **Code comment signals:**
   - FIXME: [description] → Learning: "Known issue/workaround"
   - HACK: [description] → Learning: "Temporary solution or limitation"
   - TODO: [description] → Learning: "Incomplete but important pattern"
   - NOTE: [description] → Learning: "Cautionary note or gotcha"

2. **Code pattern signals:**
   - Unusual algorithms (not standard library)
   - Memoization or caching patterns
   - Complex error handling
   - Resource management (acquire/release patterns)
   - Synchronization/concurrency patterns

3. **Code quality signals:**
   - Deeply nested logic (>4 levels) → Learning: "Complex branching gotcha"
   - Long parameter lists (>5) → Learning: "API design pattern"
   - Duplicated logic → Learning: "Missing abstraction"
   - Magic numbers → Learning: "Configuration gotcha"

**For source_type = "commit":**

1. **Commit message analysis:**
   - Extract intent from commit message
   - Identify if fix, feature, refactor, or chore
   - Look for issue numbers

2. **Diff pattern analysis:**
   - File count and types (code, tests, docs)
   - LOC added/deleted ratio
   - If heavy refactoring: "Refactoring decision"
   - If cross-module: "Integration pattern"

3. **Linked issues:**
   - Extract GitHub issue numbers
   - Categorize by issue type

**For source_type = "task":**

1. **Requirements analysis:**
   - Extract acceptance criteria
   - Note constraints or blockers
   - Identify dependencies

2. **Learning signals:**
   - "Why this design?" → Learning: "Architectural decision"
   - "Constraint: X" → Learning: "System limitation"
   - "Blocked by Y" → Learning: "Dependency management"

**For source_type = "documentation":**

1. **Architecture sections:**
   - System design decisions
   - Tradeoffs and rationale
   - Known limitations

2. **Setup/configuration:**
   - Common pitfalls mentioned
   - Configuration gotchas
   - Environment-specific issues

3. **FAQ/troubleshooting:**
   - Common errors and solutions
   - Preventative measures

**For source_type = "error":**

1. **Error trace analysis:**
   - Extract error type and message
   - Identify root cause
   - Note affected code

2. **Symptom-to-fix mapping:**
   - What manifested? (symptom)
   - Why did it happen? (root cause)
   - How was it fixed? (solution)
   - How to prevent? (prevention)

**For source_type = "review":**

1. **Review feedback patterns:**
   - Comments praising patterns → Learning: "Praised approach"
   - Comments questioning approaches → Learning: "Anti-pattern"
   - Suggestions for improvement → Learning: "Best practice"

2. **Categories:**
   - Security feedback → Learning: "Security gotcha"
   - Performance feedback → Learning: "Performance pattern"
   - Style feedback → Learning: "Coding standard"

### Step 3: Create Learning Candidates

**For each signal found, create learning object:**

```
Learning Candidate:
  Type: [gotcha | pattern | decision | technical_fix | workflow]
  Title: [Concise, actionable title]
  Problem: [Clear statement of problem/opportunity]
  Application: [How to use this learning]
  Confidence: [high | medium | low]
  Source: [File:line or commit hash or task_id]
```

**Confidence levels:**

- **High:** Clear, explicit signal (FIXME comment, documented decision)
- **Medium:** Inferred from code/commit pattern
- **Low:** Uncertain interpretation; may need human review

### Step 4: Categorize Learnings

**Assign preliminary types:**

- **Gotcha:** "Beware of X" or "Don't do X"
  - Example: "Race condition when accessing shared state"

- **Pattern:** "Effective approach for Y"
  - Example: "Memoization for expensive computations"

- **Decision:** "Why we chose X over Y"
  - Example: "Chose async/await over callbacks for readability"

- **Technical Fix:** "How to solve specific problem Z"
  - Example: "Fix import cycle by moving type to separate file"

- **Workflow:** "Process or best practice"
  - Example: "Always update docs when changing public API"

### Step 5: Extract Metadata

**For each learning, collect:**

- Source reference: file path, line range, or commit hash
- Source type: what kind of source was scanned
- Timestamp: when extraction occurred
- Context: task ID, related files, linked issues
- Confidence: high/medium/low
- Tags: optional categorization (security, performance, etc.)

### Step 6: Validate Extraction

**Check each candidate learning has:**

- ✓ Title (1 line, actionable)
- ✓ Problem (clear statement)
- ✓ Application (how/when to apply)
- ✓ Source reference (traceable)
- ✓ Type (one of 5 types)

**If validation fails:**

- Mark as low-confidence
- Continue (don't discard)

### Step 7: Generate Extraction Artifact

**Emit artifact with:**

- All extracted learning candidates
- Metadata and source references
- Confidence levels
- Extraction status (success, quality notes)
- Ready flag for next skill

## Source-Specific Guidance

### Code Scanning

**Look for these signals:**

```javascript
// FIXME: Race condition when multiple instances access cache
class Cache {
  constructor() {
    this.data = {};
  }
  // ^^ Learning: "Race condition gotcha"
}

// HACK: Temporary workaround until DB migration complete
if (legacyFormat) {
  data = convertFromLegacy(data);
}
// ^^ Learning: "Technical fix or temporary solution"

// Complex logic with nested conditions
if (auth && perms && !banned && date < expiry && verified) {
  // 5-level nesting
  // ^^ Learning: "Condition complexity pattern"
}
```

### Commit Message Scanning

```
Commit: "Fix: Race condition in cache access (closes #456)"
Extract:
  Type: technical_fix
  Title: "Use mutex to prevent race condition"
  Problem: "Multiple threads accessing shared cache"
  Application: "Add locking for shared mutable state"
  Issue: #456
```

### Error Trace Scanning

```
Error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined
Stack: at app.js:42 in processData()
Extract:
  Type: gotcha
  Title: "Null/undefined check before property access"
  Problem: "Uninitialized object passed to function"
  Application: "Always validate inputs; add null checks"
  Prevention: "Use TypeScript or strict null checking"
```

## Error Handling

| Error               | Recovery                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Invalid source_type | Ask user to clarify (code/commit/task/etc.) |
| Empty source        | Return error; ask user to provide content   |
| Unreadable format   | Ask user to provide plain text or summary   |
| No signals found    | Return empty artifact; continue to classify |
| Parse error         | Log issue; continue with parsed portion     |
