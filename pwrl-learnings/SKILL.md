# PWRL Learnings Orchestrator

Complete learning lifecycle management through 5-phase micro-skill pipeline.

## Interaction Method

- Use platform's `ask_user_questions`, `ask_user`, `ask_user_input`, `vscode/askQuestions` or any available extension/tool for user interaction for all decisions
- Ask one question at a time
- Use multiple-choice questions when possible
- If input is empty, ask: "What would you like to extract learnings from? Provide source material (code, commit, docs) or describe the topic."
- Provide clear recovery suggestions when errors occur

## Integration Points

### Input From

- pwrl-work (code changes, execution context)
- pwrl-plan (planning context, decisions)
- pwrl-review (code review insights)
- GitHub (issues, PRs, discussions)
- Error logs and debugging sessions
- Manual input from user

### Output To

## Patterns Established

1. **Pure Skill Pipeline** — 5 micro-skills in sequence, no branching
2. **Explicit Artifacts** — Each phase produces typed output for next phase
3. **Comprehensive Testing** — 240+ tests covering all scenarios
4. **Error Recovery** — Every error has user-facing explanation + fix
5. **Documentation** — README for each micro-skill + protocols
6. **Traceability** — UUID tracking from extraction through saving

## Output Structure

After successful save, learnings available in:

```
docs/learnings/
├── INDEX.md                 (all learnings)
├── BY_TYPE.md              (organized by type)
├── BY_DOMAIN.md            (organized by domain)
├── BY_SEVERITY.md          (organized by severity)
├── RECENT.md               (latest 20)
├── .index.json             (machine-readable)
├── .backups/               (recovery backups)
│   └── 2026-06-12-14-58-00.tar.gz
├── gotcha/                 (type-based folders)
│   ├── async-race-condition.md
│   └── closure-scope-trap.md
├── pattern/
├── decision/
├── technical_fix/
├── workflow/
└── archived/               (merged/deprecated)
```

## Performance Expectations

- **Extract:** <5 seconds for typical code files
- **Classify:** <2 seconds per 100 learnings
- **Structure:** <3 seconds per 100 learnings
- **Dedup:** <5 seconds per 100 learnings
- **Save:** <10 seconds for 100+ learnings (includes git commit)
- **Full Pipeline:** <30 seconds for complete workflow

## Next Phase

Phase 5: Consolidation utilities (4 micro-skills)

- Learning search and retrieval
- Analytics and reporting
- Learning export/import
- Integration with other PWRL phases

### 9. Completion Summary

Provide:

- File path created
- Brief 1-line description
- Index row added/updated in `docs/learnings/INDEX.md`
- Suggestion: any related learnings to cross-reference or update

### 10. Consider Refresh (Optional)

After documenting the new learning, evaluate whether related learnings might need updates.

**Suggest `/pwrl-refresh-learnings [scope]` when:**

- This learning contradicts or supersedes an older documented approach
- A better solution was found for a previously documented problem
- Similar/overlapping learnings were found in step 6 that could benefit from consolidation
- This fills a gap that makes an older doc incomplete or outdated

**Skip refresh when:** No related learnings found, or existing docs are still current and consistent.

**How to suggest:** Provide specific scope based on findings (e.g., file:specific-doc.md, topic-name, or category). Let user decide whether to run refresh now.

## Output

Creates categorized learning document in `docs/learnings/[category]/[slug]-[date].md` with:

- YAML frontmatter (title, date, category, tags, severity)
- Structured content following category template
- Code examples and concrete details
- Cross-references to related learnings

Also updates `docs/learnings/INDEX.md` so every learning has a short description entry.

**Directory structure example:**

- `docs/learnings/technical-fix/` — Bug fixes and error resolutions
- `docs/learnings/pattern/` — Reusable patterns and architecture
- `docs/learnings/workflow/` — Process improvements and tooling
- `docs/learnings/gotcha/` — Non-obvious behaviors and edge cases
- `docs/learnings/concept/` — Technology and framework understanding
- `docs/learnings/decision/` — Why specific approaches were chosen

## Best Practices

- **Capture while fresh**: Document right after solving, while context is loaded
- **Be specific**: Include exact error messages, file paths, code snippets
- **Explain why**: Future you won't have the context you have now
- **Tag liberally**: Use 3-5 tags that you'd actually search for
- **Link related learnings**: Reference other docs that connect
- **Update > duplicate**: If a similar doc exists, enhance it rather than creating a new one
