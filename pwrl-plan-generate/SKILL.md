# pwrl-plan-generate — Plan Generation

**Purpose:** Final output step in the planning workflow. Accepts scoped context, research findings, and implementation units from upstream skills (S2→S3→S4). Selects the appropriate tier (Fast/Standard/Deep), renders the plan from the templates reference file, embeds related learnings, and saves it to `docs/plans/`.

## Interaction Method

- Use the platform's `ask_user_questions` extension for confirmations and overrides.
- Present tier selection and plan preview before saving.
- Ask one question at a time. Use multiple-choice for tier override.

## Input

This skill expects three inputs:

1. **Scoped context** from `pwrl-plan-scope` (S2) — problem, criteria, domain, learnings
2. **Research findings** from `pwrl-plan-research` (S3) — patterns, risk, constraints
3. **Implementation units** from `pwrl-plan-design` (S4) — U-IDs, files, approach, criteria

If inputs are missing, search for recent scope/research/design files or prompt the user to run prerequisite skills first.

## Output: Plan File

After completing the workflow, a plan file is saved to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-<kebab-case-name>.md`. The function returns: `{ file_path: "docs/plans/...md", tier: "Fast", summary: "..." }`. For detailed schema documentation, file structure, frontmatter specification, content requirements per tier, storage conventions, and versioning rules, see **[state-schema.md](references/state-schema.md)**.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Tier Selection

1. Read the complexity hint from S4's output and the research findings.
2. Apply the heuristic to determine initial tier:

   | Unit Count | Risk Level         | Initial Tier |
   | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
   | 1-3        | LOW                | Fast         |
   | 1-3        | MEDIUM or HIGH     | Standard     |
   | 4-8        | any                | Standard     |
   | 9+         | any                | Deep         |
   | any        | 2+ high-risk areas | Deep         |

3. Present to user: "Based on [N] units and [risk] risk level, the recommended tier is **[Tier]**. Would you like to use this tier or choose a different one?"
   - Options: Accept [Tier], Select Fast, Select Standard, Select Deep
4. Apply user's choice.
5. Document the tier selection rationale in the plan.

### Step 2: Load Template

1. Read the appropriate template from `pwrl-plan/references/plan-templates.md`.
2. Select the template section matching the chosen tier (Fast, Standard, or Deep).
3. If the template cannot be loaded, fall back to the inline template definitions in this skill.

### Step 3: Render Plan Sections

Use the loaded template to populate each section based on the chosen tier. For detailed rendering logic, section requirements per tier (Fast/Standard/Deep), template structure, and examples, see **[render-workflow.md](references/render-workflow.md)**.

### Step 4: Embed Learnings

1. From S2's `Related Learnings` list, add to the plan:

   ```
   ## Related Learnings

   - **[Learning Title]** — `docs/learnings/XXX.md` — [1-line applicability note]
   ```

2. From S2's `Learning Gaps` list, add to the plan:

   ```
   ## Learning Gaps

   - **[Gap Name]** — *Action:* Document via `/pwrl-learnings` after implementation
   ```

3. If no learnings or gaps exist, still include the sections:
   - "No relevant learnings found"
   - "No learning gaps identified at this time"

### Step 4.5: NEW - Write Intermediate Plan Files to Disk

**Purpose:** Persist planning state for audit trail and multi-session resumption.

**Timing:** Write intermediate files after S2 scope, after S3 research, after S4 design.

**Files written:**

1. **Scope file** (after S2 completes):
   - Path: `docs/plans/.scope/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-scope.md`
   - Contains: Problem statement, criteria, domain validation, related learnings
   - Frontmatter: `id`, `status: "scope-complete"`, `created`, `updated`

2. **Research file** (after S3 completes):
   - Path: `docs/plans/.research/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-research.md`
   - Contains: Risk assessment, patterns found, constraints, research findings
   - Frontmatter: `id`, `status: "research-complete"`, `updated`

3. **Design file** (after S4 completes):
   - Path: `docs/plans/.design/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-design.md`
   - Contains: Implementation units, dependencies, approach, verification criteria
   - Frontmatter: `id`, `status: "design-complete"`, `updated`

**Config handling (from `.pwrlrc.json`):**

```json
{
  "intermediatePlanFiles": "persist" // or "archive" or "delete"
}
```

- **"persist"**: Keep all intermediate files; user can review planning history
- **"archive"**: After final plan generated, move intermediate files to `docs/plans/.archive/`
- **"delete"**: After final plan generated, delete intermediate files

**Default:** "persist" (safest for audit trail)

**Implementation:**

```pseudocode
writeIntermediateFiles(scope, research, design, config):
  writeToFile("docs/plans/.scope/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-scope.md", scope)
  writeToFile("docs/plans/.research/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-research.md", research)
  writeToFile("docs/plans/.design/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-design.md", design)

  log("Intermediate files written for plan YYYY-MM-DD-NNN")
```

**Cleanup (after final plan saved):**

```pseudocode
cleanupIntermediateFiles(planId, config):
  if config.intermediatePlanFiles == "archive":
    move("docs/plans/.scope/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-scope.md", "docs/plans/.archive/")
    move("docs/plans/.research/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-research.md", "docs/plans/.archive/")
    move("docs/plans/.design/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-design.md", "docs/plans/.archive/")
    log("Intermediate files archived")

  else if config.intermediatePlanFiles == "delete":
    delete("docs/plans/.scope/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-scope.md")
    delete("docs/plans/.research/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-research.md")
    delete("docs/plans/.design/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-design.md")
    log("Intermediate files deleted")

  else:  # "persist" (default)
    log("Intermediate files persisted for future reference")

### Step 5: Generate Filename

1. Format: `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-<kebab-case-name>.md`
2. Components:
   - **Date:** Today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - **NNN:** Sequential 3-digit number (001, 002, 003...)
   - **Name:** Kebab-case slug from the plan title
3. Avoid collisions:
   - Read `docs/plans/` directory
   - Find the highest existing NNN for today's date
   - Increment: new NNN = max NNN + 1
   - Example: if `2026-06-05-001-...` exists, next is `2026-06-05-002-...`

### Step 6: Validate Plan

Before saving, validate:

- [ ] Frontmatter: id, status, tier, created, updated are present and valid
- [ ] All required sections present for the chosen tier (see Required Sections Per Tier in plan-templates.md)
- [ ] All file paths are repository-relative (no /home/user/... paths)
- [ ] Related Learnings section exists (even if empty)
- [ ] Learning Gaps section exists (even if empty)
- [ ] No empty placeholders remain (e.g., `{{GOAL}}` or `[placeholder]`)
- [ ] Plan is valid markdown (can be read without parse errors)

### Step 7: Confirm and Save

1. Present the plan preview to the user via `ask_user_questions`:
   - Show: tier selected, filename, first 500 characters of the plan
2. Ask: "Shall I save this plan to `[filename]`?"
   - Options: Yes, Edit (iterate on sections), Cancel
3. If Yes: Write the file and confirm.
4. If Edit: Iterate on specific sections the user wants changed.
5. If Cancel: Discard and exit.
6. After saving: Run cleanup (Step 4.5 cleanup logic per config)
7. Return the file path and a brief summary.

## Edge Cases

Seven edge cases commonly encountered during generation: template loading failure, filename collisions, tier override after preview, minimal research findings, unit count/complexity mismatch, empty complex sections, and multiple plans with same date/title. For handling strategies, decision trees, and examples, see **[edge-cases.md](references/edge-cases.md)**.
