# Planning Tiers: Fast, Standard, Deep

This document describes the three planning tiers and when to use each.

---

## Overview

pwrl-plan supports three tiers of planning detail:

| Tier         | Complexity | Risk   | Time      | Units | Use Case                                          |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------ | --------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fast**     | Low        | Low    | 5-15 min  | 1-3   | Small tweaks, bug fixes, well-understood tasks    |
| **Standard** | Medium     | Medium | 30-45 min | 4-8   | Most features, moderate complexity                |
| **Deep**     | High       | High   | 1-2 hours | 9+    | Architecture, security, migrations, cross-cutting |

### Decision Criteria

Choose **Standard** if:

- ✅ 4-8 files affected OR 1-3 files with complexity
- ✅ 2-5 key technical decisions needed
- ✅ One high-risk area with sufficient local examples
- ✅ OR multiple medium-risk areas
- ✅ Can be completed in 2-6 hours

## Deep Tier

**Best for:** Complex, high-risk work requiring extensive design and alternatives analysis.

### Characteristics

- **File Scope:** 9+ files affected
- **Decision Complexity:** 5+ key technical decisions or significant architectural impact
- **Risk Level:** HIGH (2+ high-risk areas, security/payment/infrastructure, or major migration)
- **Examples:** Authentication system overhaul, payment integration, infrastructure migration, major refactor, security audit implementation
- **Time to Plan:** 1-2 hours

## Tier Selection Heuristic

### Step 1: Count Implementation Units

- **1-3 units:** Candidate for Fast
- **4-8 units:** Candidate for Standard
- **9+ units:** Must be Deep

### Step 2: Assess Risk Level

Scan task description for high-risk keywords:

| Area           | Keywords                                  | Risk Level |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Security       | auth, jwt, oauth, session, encryption     | HIGH       |
| Payments       | payment, billing, stripe, checkout        | HIGH       |
| APIs           | api, rest, graphql, endpoint, integration | MEDIUM     |
| Migrations     | migration, upgrade, data, schema, version | MEDIUM     |
| Complex Logic  | algorithm, analysis, processing, compute  | MEDIUM     |
| Infrastructure | deploy, kubernetes, docker, scaling       | HIGH       |

### Step 3: Apply Heuristic

| Units | Risk               | Tier     |
| ----- | ------------------ | -------- |
| 1-3   | LOW                | Fast     |
| 1-3   | MEDIUM or HIGH     | Standard |
| 4-8   | any                | Standard |
| 9+    | any                | Deep     |
| any   | 2+ high-risk areas | Deep     |

## Overriding Tier Selection

Users can override the recommended tier in the plan generation phase:

- **Upgrade to Standard/Deep:** If more detail or confidence is needed
- **Downgrade to Fast:** If simpler than heuristic suggests (rare)

All overrides are documented in the plan for future reference.
