# PWRL Work

Execute implementation work through a deterministic 4-phase pipeline: triage input, prepare environment, implement with test-first discipline, and review code quality.

## Interaction Method

- Use platform's `ask_user_question`, `ask_user`, `ask_user_input`, `vscode/askQuestions` or any available extension/tool for user interaction for all decisions
- Ask one question at a time
- Use multiple-choice questions when possible
- If input is empty, ask: "What work would you like to execute? Provide a task file path, plan file, or describe the work to be done."
- Provide clear recovery suggestions when errors occur

## Purpose

Transform task files, plans, or prompts into completed working code through systematic execution:

- **Triage Input** — Classify and validate input (task file, plan file, bare prompt, or latest task)
- **Prepare Environment** — Repository verification, ambiguity resolution, branch setup, verification commands
- **Execute Implementation** — Test-first implementation with incremental verification and quality gates
- **Review & Verify** — Code review, scope check, diff quality, documentation

## Usage

```bash
/pwrl-work
/pwrl-work docs/tasks/to-do/2026-06-11-U2-email-validation.md
/pwrl-work docs/plans/2026-06-11-003-skill-architecture.md
/pwrl-work "add email validation to user signup"
```

## Architecture

**Direct sequence of 4 micro-skills with deterministic artifact flow:**

```
Input
  ↓
Phase 0: pwrl-work-triage
  ├ Input: task file, plan file, bare prompt, or empty
  ├ Output: triage artifact (unit_id, files, acceptance_criteria, dependencies)
  ↓
Phase 1: pwrl-work-prepare
  ├ Input: triage artifact
  ├ Processing: repo verification, ambiguity resolution, branch strategy, verification commands
  ├ Output: prepare artifact (branch, verification_commands, environment state)
  ↓
Phase 2: pwrl-work-execute
  ├ Input: prepare artifact
  ├ Processing: scaffolding, test-first implementation, quality gates
  ├ Output: execute artifact (files changed, tests passing, build/lint status)
  ↓
Phase 3: pwrl-work-review
  ├ Input: execute artifact
  ├ Processing: scope check, diff review, test review, documentation check
  ├ Output: review artifact (approval status, ready_to_ship)
  ↓
COMPLETE
```

Each phase produces an explicit **artifact** (YAML frontmatter + structured data) consumed by the next phase. Enables resumability, traceability, and independent testing.

## Phase Summary

**Phase 0: Triage** — Validate input, classify work, extract requirements. See [pwrl-work-triage/SKILL.md](../pwrl-work-triage/SKILL.md).

**Phase 1: Prepare** — Verify repository, resolve ambiguities, setup branch and environment. See [pwrl-work-prepare/SKILL.md](../pwrl-work-prepare/SKILL.md).

**Phase 2: Execute** — Implement with test-first discipline, verify quality gates. See [pwrl-work-execute/SKILL.md](../pwrl-work-execute/SKILL.md).

**Phase 3: Review** — Verify scope, review code quality, get approval. See [pwrl-work-review/SKILL.md](../pwrl-work-review/SKILL.md).

## Quality Criteria

- Requirements from task/plan fully implemented
- Behavior changes covered by tests
- Tests pass after each logical unit
- Code follows project patterns and conventions
- No debug code, console.logs, or commented code left behind
- Scope stayed tight (no unrelated changes)

## Rules

- **Clarify ambiguities upfront** — Don't proceed if approach is unclear
- **Verify incrementally** — Run checks frequently, catch issues early
- **Test-first discipline** — Write tests before implementing
- **One scope at a time** — Complete and review each unit separately
- **No scope creep** — Get approval before expanding beyond task
- **Quality gates** — All checks must pass before marking ready

## Error Handling & Recovery

For comprehensive error scenarios, recovery strategies, and escalation rules, see [references/error-handling.md](references/error-handling.md).

## Support Files

- `pwrl-work-triage/references/triage-input-protocol.md` — Phase 0 specification
- `pwrl-work-prepare/references/prepare-environment-protocol.md` — Phase 1 specification
- `pwrl-work-execute/references/execute-implementation-protocol.md` — Phase 2 specification
- `pwrl-work-review/references/review-quality-protocol.md` — Phase 3 specification

## When to Use

- Use when executing a clear task from a task file
- Use when extracting and executing units from a plan
- Use for well-defined work with clear acceptance criteria
- For exploratory work without clear requirements, use `/pwrl-plan` first
